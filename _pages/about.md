I am a computational scientist with engineering background and really passionate about mathematics and its real-world applications. I am motivated self-starter and analytical problem solver who views obstacles as challenges!


I hold a PhD in Financial Mathematics, building upon my dual masterâ€™s degrees in petroleum engineering and applied mathematics. My research and expertise focus on advanced mathematical modeling and numerical methods applied to quantitative finance, including stochastic processes, option pricing, and risk management.

Throughout my doctoral studies, I have developed strong skills in solving complex partial differential equations and implementing computational techniques relevant to financial markets. I specialize in leveraging deep learning and reinforcement learning methods to address and solve challenging problems in financial mathematics.

As a dedicated researcher and problem solver, I am passionate about applying rigorous mathematical approaches to address challenges in finance and beyond.
