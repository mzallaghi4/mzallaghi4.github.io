I am a computational scientist with engineering background and really passionate about mathematics and its real-world applications. I am motivated self-starter and analytical problem solver who views obstacles as challenges!

I have completed two master's degrees in petroleum engineering and applied mathematics with overlapping areas of interest in fluid dynamics in porous media.
As a motivated problem solver and diligent learner, I have developed proficiency in mathematical modelling and numerical skills. I have focused my applied mathematics degree on the numerical solution of fluid dynamics problems, taking graduate-level courses in numerical analysis, finite element analysis, and numerical solution of PDE problems. I have also gained significant experience adapting to different CFD packages (e.g., OpenFOAM) and programming languages for scientific computing and machine learning, including MATLAB, Python, and C++.




My research interests
======
-- Numerical Methods for PDEs

-- Optimization and Control Theory 

-- Machine Learning and Deep Learning


My Projects
======
1. Direct numerical simulations of multiphase flows
2. Data-driven control system (particularly Reinforcement Learning-Based) 
3. Deep Learning for Computer vision and Digital image processing 


MY Research Plan
======
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository.


The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
