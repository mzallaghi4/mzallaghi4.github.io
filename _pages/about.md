This is the front page of a website that is powered by ME!


I am a computational scientist with engineering background and really passionate about mathematics and its real-world applications.

I am motivated self-starter and analytical problem solver who views obstacles as challenges!





My research interests
======
-- Numerical Methods for PDEs

-- Optimization and Control Theory 

-- Machine Learning and Deep Learning


My Projects
======
1. Direct numerical simulations of multiphase flows
2. Data-driven control system (particularly Reinforcement Learning-Based) 
3. Deep Learning for Computer vision and Digital image processing 


MY Research Plan
======
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository.


The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
