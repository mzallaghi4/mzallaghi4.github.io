I am a computational scientist with engineering background and really passionate about mathematics and its real-world applications. I am motivated self-starter and analytical problem solver who views obstacles as challenges!

I have completed two master's degrees in petroleum engineering and applied mathematics with overlapping areas of interest in fluid dynamics in porous media.
As a motivated problem solver and diligent learner, I have developed proficiency in mathematical modelling and numerical skills. I have focused my applied mathematics degree on the numerical solution of fluid dynamics problems, taking graduate-level courses in numerical analysis, finite element analysis, and numerical solution of PDE problems. I have also gained significant experience adapting to different CFD packages (e.g., OpenFOAM) and programming languages for scientific computing and machine learning, including MATLAB, Python, and C++.
