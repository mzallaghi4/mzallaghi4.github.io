This is a description of tutorial on Numerical Methods for Fluid Flow Simulation

Numerical methods are essential for fluid flow simulation, which is a critical aspect of engineering and science. These methods involve the use of mathematical algorithms to solve complex fluid flow problems that cannot be solved analytically. Numerical methods enable the modeling of complex physical phenomena, such as  multiphase flows in porous media.

One key numerical method used in fluid flow simulation is the finite element method (FEM). FEM involves dividing the fluid domain into small elements and solving equations for each element using numerical techniques. 
Another important method is the finite volume method (FVM), which involves discretizing the fluid domain into small control volumes and solving equations for each volume.
