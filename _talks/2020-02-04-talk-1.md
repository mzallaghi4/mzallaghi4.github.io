Title: An overlapping domain decompostion for optimal control problems

Optimal control problems involve finding the best control strategy for a given system to achieve a desired objective. Domain decomposition involves dividing the problem domain into smaller subdomains, each of which is solved independently before being combined to obtain the overall solution.

The advantage of domain decomposition is that it allows parallel processing and reduces computational time. It also allows the use of different numerical methods in each subdomain, which can be selected based on their suitability for that specific subdomain.

Furthermore, domain decomposition can be used to handle complex systems with multiple objectives or constraints. For instance, if different parts of a system have conflicting objectives or constraints, they can be separated into different subdomains and solved independently.

Domain decomposition is an effective technique for solving optimal control problems by breaking down complex systems into smaller manageable parts.
